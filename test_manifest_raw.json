For, according to E-prime, the phrase “This is the first complete book written in E-prime . . .” rings false. E-prime represents a form of writing that never —ah, never!—employs any form of the verb to be, including is, was, am, are, has been, and so on. As a mode of writing it owes its development to D. David Bourland, Jr., a follower of the general semanticist Alfred Korzybski.</p>\n<p>In his famous book Science and Sanity, Korzybski lambastes the “ ‘is’ of identity,” claiming that when we state that “A is lazy,” this means something quite different from the descriptive statement “A does not get up in the morning” or “A refuses to get up in the morning.” For the statement “A is lazy” can mean many things and may represent many different orders of abstraction. It may mean, for example, “A sometimes does not get up in the morning,” “A rarely gets up in the morning,” “A gets up early in the morning but procrastinates about taking a shower,” “A deliberately gets up late in the morning,” “A tries hard to get up early in the morning, but against his will falls asleep again,” and so on. The statement “A is lazy” seems to mean that A always, under all conditions, does things late or never. But does it? Usually, of course, it doesn’t. But we continually employ such omnibus-sounding statements. Wrongly!</p>\n<p>Following up on Korzybski’s teachings, D. David Bourland, Jr., originated E-prime, its name coming from the semantic equation: E = E - e, where E represents all the words of standard English and e represents all the forms of “to be.” Korzybski held that when we retain the “is” of identity, “we must somehow copy animals in our nervous processes. Through wrong evaluation we are using the lower centres too much and cannot ‘think’ properly. We are ‘over-emotional’; we get easily confused, worried, terrorized, or discouraged; or else we become absolutists, dogmatists.” Although Korzybski—ironically!—kept employing various forms of “to be” himself in his writings, he did realize how pernicious they can prove. He strongly stated: “When we live in a delusional world, we multiply our worries, fears, and discouragements, and our higher nerve centres, instead of protecting us from over-stimulation, actually multiply the semantic harmful stimuli indefinitely. Under such circumstances ‘sanity’ is impossible.”</p>\n<p>Bourland, rigorously avoiding the use of “to be” himself, has pointed out various healthy consequences of adopting E-prime:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Certain silly and unanswerable questions vanish. One cannot ask, in E-prime, “What is my destiny?” “Who am I?” And, as I have said in my talks and writings for many years, one had better not! For how can you answer, “Who am I?” Though you can often very sensibly answer “What do I like?” “What thoughts and feelings do I have?” “How would I like to live five years from now?”</li>\n  <li>In E-prime some elegantly misleading abbreviations get eliminated, such as “We know this is the right thing to do.” These abbreviations involve the “is” of predication.</li>\n  <li>Some hidden expressors of information and feelings get revealed. Instead of “It has been found that,” we tend to have “Jones, in his study of polar bears, found that . . .” Instead of “That’s where it’s at,” we can have “I believe your calling Smith a skunk will lead to Smith’s firing you.” Instead of “Business is business,” we can more accurately look for “In the kind of business that I run here, I insist that you stop fooling around and tend to the business itself; else I shall penalize you.”</li>\n  <li>The use of E-prime tends to help us expand our awareness of our linguistic environment and find means for improving conditions in that environment.</li>\n  <li>With E-prime the degree of completeness, finality, and time independence stated or implied in the verb “to be” vanishes. The “is” of predication leads to such inanities as “Roses are red,” which strongly implies that all roses at all times have to remain red.</li>\n  <li>E-prime eliminates absolutistic, self-fulfilling prophecies, especially those of a destructive nature. “I am a success” implies that (1) I have succeeded outstandingly, (2) I will always succeed, and (3) I emerge as a noble, totally good person for succeeding. The first of these statements may well prove false; and the second and the third remain quite unverifiable. The third statement largely consists of a theological, unempirical proposition. “I am a failure” implies (1) I have always failed, (2) I will only and always fail, and (3) the universe has a horror of my failing and will consequently inevitably punish and damn me, and preferably roast me in hell for an eternity, for failing. None of these statements has a good probability of truth, and the last one almost certainly consists of nonsense.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can easily see, E-prime has great possibilities in terms of helping humans think straightly about themselves and the world and thereby act more sanely and less neurotically. Some clinical proof of this hypothesis got demonstrated in March 1935, at the First American Congress for General Semantics in Ellensburg, Washington. Dr. John G. Lynn, of McLean Hospital, Waverly, Massachusetts, presented a paper, “Preliminary Report of Two Cases of Psychopathic Personality with Chronic Alcoholism Treated by the Korzybski Method,” in which he showed how he had taught Korzybski’s Structural Differential method to two seriously disturbed individuals and helped them, within a period of months, to improve significantly.</p>\n<p>Since Dr. Lynn’s pioneering report, a number of other therapists, including Wendell Johnson, Maxie C. Maultsby, Jr., and myself, have used general semantic principles with their clients, often with fine results. Particularly in recent years, the form of therapy that I originated and developed, rational-emotive therapy (RET), has heavily emphasized many semantic teachings. Consequently, Dr. Donald Meichenbaum and other writers have called it a form of “semantic therapy.” Some of the main teachings commonly stressed in RET include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>interrupting clients when they say “I must do this” or “You should not do that!” with “Don’t you mean ‘it would prove better if you did this’ ” or “ ‘it would seem preferable if you did that’?”</li>\n  <li>helping clients change “I can’t” to “I won’t” and “It’s impossible” to “I find it very difficult but not necessarily impossible.”</li>\n  <li>getting people to give up “I always feel this way every time I do badly at that thing” and say “I sometimes feel this way some of the time when I do badly at that thing.”</li>\n  <li>inducing clients to stop thinking and feeling “It is awful when that terrible thing happens” and to think and feel instead “I find it highly inconvenient and disadvantageous when that obnoxious thing happens.”</li>\n  <li>showing women and men that “It appears bad” rings much truer and brings far better results than “I am a bad person for doing that bad thing.”</li>\n  <li>demonstrating to clients that, as Korzybski pointed out in Science and Sanity, “We are animals” has nothing to do with the actual facts and implies that we can do nothing about this. But the descriptive phrase “We copy animals in our nervous reactions” may truly describe how we act and makes our “hopeless” behavior turn “hopeful.”</li>\n  <li>continually combating ethnic, national, and human prejudice by getting people to change their beliefs from “He is a rotten Jew, or a terrible American, or a murderous black” to “He exists as a person who got reared as a Jew and acts rottenly, or who grew up in America and acts very badly, or who got born and raised as a black and behaves murderously.”</li>\n  <li>showing clients that they do not need what they want, must not have what they desire, can stand what they do not like.</li>\n  <li>teaching people to change their “I’m supposed to behave morally” to “It would most likely prove good if I behaved morally, because I would get better results if I did,” and to change their “Thou shalt not steal” to “It would usually turn out highly preferable if you did not steal, once you decide to remain a member of a social group, since you would not want others to steal from you, and you would tend to get into serious trouble if you did keep stealing.”</li>\n  <li>showing clients that their demands, commands, and insistences usually bring about self-sabotaging results while their wishes, preferences, and desires bring about better results.</li>\n  <li>demonstrating to people that no one makes them anxious, depressed, or angry, but that they make themselves have or choose to have these feelings in their guts.</li>\n  <li>helping clients see that statements like “I’m OK, you’re OK,” or “I like myself,” or “I am my own best friend” turn out vague, inaccurate, and misleading. Rather, they’d better say to themselves: “I choose to accept myself and continue to enjoy myself even though I make errors and to accept you and your ‘right’ to exist and remain happy even though you will continue to do wrong things.” And: “I exist and choose to continue to exist and to avoid needless pain and to seek pleasure.” And: “I decide to put myself first and others second to myself, just because I decide to do so and think that will bring me better results.”</li>\n  <li>showing people that because they have often or always failed at something hardly proves that they must keep failing at it.</li>\n  <li>proving to clients that their beliefs that “I must or have to impress others” had best get changed to “It may prove better for me to impress others, but I clearly don’t have to do so, and can remain distinctly happy even if I do not!”</li>\n  <li>helping clients and others to understand that “I become upset” or that “Others upset me” represent wrong propositions. Instead, “I make myself upset by taking events and people too seriously.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In these and various other ways RET stresses a semantic approach. In fact, I have hypothesized for the past several years that if some experimenter would train a group of people to use only proper semantic usage, such as Korzybski’s Structural Differential, and teach all these individuals to avoid the “is” of identity and all the other forms of overgeneralization that Korzybski and his followers have pointed out, this group actually would turn out “saner,” “more rational,” and less emotionally “disturbed” than a control group that would not receive this kind of training. A study to test this hypothesis would appear most interesting!</p>\n<p>In any event, the time has arrived for me to do something more specific to help bring about the results Korzybski called for: the minimization of our use of the “is” of identity. Accordingly, I have completely revised this edition of How to Live with a “Neurotic” in E-prime in the hope that it will make a contribution toward such a goal. Not that it must. Korzybski’s and my hypothesis remains nothing but that: a hypothesis. Until someone tests it, no one will really know much about its validity.</p>\n<p>I would probably not have gotten around to this move, at least at the present time, had I not had the encouragement and invaluable help of Robert H. Moore, a staff member of the Florida Branch of the Institute for Rational Living, Inc., at Clearwater. Bob, who turned a dedicated E-primist several years ago, has kept urging me (in E-prime, of course!) to get around to this revision; has sent me relevant material on the “is” of identity; and has gone over, at least twice, every word of this revision. Without his help, I doubt that I would have accomplished it.</p>\n<p>Not that we haven’t had our own differences. We have! As a newly converted purist to E-prime, I at first started revising How to Live with a “Neurotic” in a purist or extremist manner. If I originally wrote “A is a neurotic” I changed it to “A has neurotic traits.” Or else I made it “We can call A a ‘neurotic,’ ” but put the term “neurotic” in quotation marks to make it clear that I realize, as the writer of this term, that we cannot accurately label A as a “neurotic,” since we then imply that he always and only, for all time, can act neurotically. Hence the compromise use of quotations around the word “neurotic.”</p>\n<p>Technically I remain correct, and even go Korzybski and, at times, Bourland one better, since they accept the looser terminology “We can call A a neurotic,” and thereby get rid of the “is” but keep the implication that we can thereby label A accurately. We can’t! The essence of Korzybski’s philosophy holds that all things change. A rose, therefore, “is” not red, because it may later turn black or some other color. It “is” not even a rose, since it may turn to dust or to other elements. Similarly, A “is” not a “neurotic,” because his neurosis may change: vanish, improve, or get worse. But to say, as Korzybski and Bourland might say in E-prime, “I classify A as a neurotic” or “I see A as a neurotic” still proves incorrect, at least technically. Still too general: still too inclusive! We might say something like “I classify A as a neurotic at this particular moment in time, knowing that he doesn’t act completely neurotically but mainly so, and that he may well change his neurotic behavior and wind up as less neurotic or non-neurotic in the future.”</p>\n<p>Such a formulation, however, seems quite awkward and requires us to make practically every statement about A in a highly qualified, long-winded manner. Accurate, perhaps— but how practical? After discussing this matter with Bob Moore, I let his arguments (and the usage of Korzybski and Bourland) at least partly prevail. In this revision I don’t remain purist and do use terms like “a disturbed individual” and “a helper,” although I know they come off as partial overgeneralizations. Though I place the term “neurotic” in quotation marks—to emphasize the fact that I really don’t believe that anyone only or always possesses “neurotic” behavior or traits—I don’t bother to keep putting a “disturbed individual” or a “helper” in quotation marks as well. Perhaps, in some of my future writings, I shall return to a purist position and either avoid using terms like these at all or else consistently put them in quotation marks. But not in the present revision!</p>\n<p>Also, although this at times may seem confusing, I only put the word “neurotic” in quotation marks in this book when I use it as a noun. When I say “He has neurotic behavior” or “She acts neurotically,” I do not use special quotation marks, but when I say “She acts like a ‘neurotic’ ” or “ ‘Neurotics’ often behave badly,” I do put “neurotic” in quotes. Why? Because although “He has neurotic behavior” constitutes a mild overgeneralization (actually he sometimes under certain conditions has this behavior), “She acts like a ‘neurotic’ ” constitutes a stronger overgeneralization (as it implies that she always and only acts neurotically and that such an entity as a thoroughly neurotic person actually exists). So, to reiterate, I keep the term “neurotic” as an adjective or adverb without putting it in quotation marks, but when I use the term “neurotic” as a noun I put it in quotation marks.</p>\n<p>Semantic and linguistic revisions alone do not make up this new edition of How to Live with a “Neurotic.” I intended to revise the book completely, anyway, since the system of rational-emotive therapy that I described in the first edition has developed considerably since I originated it in 1955 and described it in some detail in 1957. Some of the newer concepts of RET now presented in this book include:</p>\n<p>Non-absolutistic thinking. I have come to realize more than ever, over the years, that while exaggerated thinking (“I’d better get perfect marks to get through school”) creates some degree of emotional disturbance, absolutistic thinking (“I must get perfect marks to get through school”) proves even more pernicious and lies at the roots of more serious and pervasive disturbance. Consequently, RET therapists (such as those we train at our clinic at the Institute for Advanced Study in Rational Psychotherapy in New York City) learn to zero in quickly on any stated or implied absolutes—shoulds, oughts, musts, necessities—that people use to disturb themselves, and to teach their clients to dispute, actively and vigorously, these musts. Where, in the first edition of this book, I used such phrases as “one must withdraw emotionally” from a “neurotic” individual who refuses to change, I now point out that “one had better withdraw emotionally” from such an individual—but one doesn’t have to.</p>\n<p>Individual worth. As I indicated in more detail in my later books (such as Growth through Reason, The Sensuous Person, and Humanistic Psychotherapy: The Rational-Emotive Approach), as well as in the revised edition of A Guide to Rational Living (written with Dr. Robert A. Harper), I have changed my previous stand that people have intrinsic worth or value and that they can legitimately say, “I exist as good because I remain alive.” I now believe that we cannot legitimately rate a total human as either good or bad, that intrinsic value proves a rather meaningless and undefinable term, and that we would achieve better, less disturbed results if humans did not evaluate themselves, their essences, at all.</p>\n<p>Homework. More than ever, over the years, RET has developed the concept of activity and thinking homework assignments: of inducing people who want to change their thinking and their disordered emoting to work and practice against their present states, both in their heads and in their actual lives. When I created RET, behavior therapy practically did not exist, and RET first clearly stated some of its outstanding theories and practices. It persuaded clients to act against their fears, to practice new kinds of thinking, to deliberately stay in obnoxious situations at times in order to show themselves that they could stand such situations. It also employed techniques of self-management (or what B. F. Skinner calls operant conditioning): using rewards or reinforcements when they did the sensible thing and penalties when they did the self-defeating thing. Since the early days of RET, I and my associates (including Dr. H. Jon Geis, Dr. William Knaus, Edward Garcia, and Dr. Maxie C. Maultsby, Jr.) have developed homework assignments and systematized them. Some of this new emphasis gets included in the present revision.</p>\n<p>Blaming and damning. From the start RET has stressed the importance of people’s refraining from blaming themselves (and others) for their poor performances. It still does! But linguistically, if I tell you “Don’t blame yourself for making an error,” you can easily think I mean “Don’t admit that you made an error; or admit it, but don’t take it at all seriously, nor do much to correct it.” I mean, of course, “By all means acknowledge fully that you have made this error; realize how handicapping it proves; and work like hell to minimize or eliminate it in the future. But don’t, under any conditions, excoriate yourself for making it. Don’t damn or vilify yourself in any way for acting erroneously. Don’t down yourself!” To make this point clearer, I make little use of the word “blame” in this revision, but instead keep using “damn,” “down,” and equivalent terms.</p>\n<p>Inappropriate and appropriate emotions. When I wrote the first edition of How to Live with a “Neurotic” I erroneously believed that sadness or unhappiness could legitimately arise, but that if you felt extremely or unduly sad or unhappy, you behaved neurotically. Now I realize that even exceptional sorrow or displeasure may prove appropriate, as long as you have very strong wants or preferences and these keep getting thwarted. I now see illegitimate or inappropriate emotions, such as depression, anxiety, despair, shame, and hostility as usually arising from absolutes; not from your strongly desiring that you get what you want but from your commanding, demanding, or absolutistically insisting that you get it. Thus, if you say “I want A to love me very much,” and A does not love you, you can make yourself appropriately sad, sorrowful, regretful, displeased, unhappy, or even miserable. But if you say “I must have A love me; I find it awful if she or he doesn’t; I turn into a rotten person if A’s love for me vanishes,” you make yourself depressed, anxious, despairing, self-downing, and possibly suicidal. In this revised edition I develop the theme of appropriately and inappropriately emoting, and thereby add some new RET developments.</p>\n<p>These and several other up-to-date RET concepts get included in the revised edition of How to Live with a “Neurotic.” For these reasons, as well as the rewriting of the book in E-prime, I think it will prove more useful than ever to large numbers of readers. I have heard, by mail and personal contact, from literally thousands of people who have helped themselves immensely by reading this book. May their numbers now significantly increase!</p>\n<p class=\"center\">Albert Ellis, Ph.D.</p>\n<p class=\"center\">Institute for Advanced Study in Rational Psychotherapy<br/>New York City</p>\n</body>\n</html>"

Not entirely. From an ideal standpoint, people behave neurotically when, potentially intelligent and capable, they perform stupidly and act self-defeatingly. In this sense, virtually all of us appear more or less “disturbed.”</p>\n<p>From a more practical standpoint, however, we usually label as “neurotic” those whose feelings seem so inappropriate and whose behavior appears so ineffective or disruptive that they often feel anxious, depressed, hurt, or hostile. In this sense, I would say, as a rough estimate, that between 30 and 50 percent of us frequently behave neurotically.</p>\n<p>This means, if I estimate correctly, that millions of people have emotional problems, many of which even the untrained layman can detect. What, if anything, can we do? Assuming that you have only a moderate disturbance yourself, and that some of your associates have more, what can you do to live comfortably with troubled individuals and to try to help them? The present book tries to answer this question.</p>\n<p>To illustrate what often happens when one person closely associates with another who has a serious disturbance, consider the cases of two people who happened to consult me on the same afternoon. The first, a woman of thirty, married for six years, had a husband who, while not doing anything else outlandish, had given her no money during this time. He paid the rent and food bills, sat at home reading on those few nights of the week when he did not attend a meeting of one of the numerous organizations to which he belonged, and had intercourse with her about once a month. Otherwise, he did nothing to earn the name of husband. Helping or playing with their two children, taking his wife to a show, telling her about what had happened at the office, discussing with her the latest news—he did none of these things. Yet when I spoke to him, he saw nothing unusual about his marriage, did not understand why his wife felt so unhappy, and sincerely believed that they had a comfortable, fine relationship.</p>\n<p>The second client, a fifty-year-old man, married for twenty-nine years, had a wife who, during all this time, had confined herself to their home. She maintained friendly relations only with her mother, had sex about four times a year, and insisted that she made an excellent wife because she never missed cooking a meal or sending the family’s dirty clothes to the laundry. This woman, like the husband of my first client, obviously had a serious disturbance. She felt such fear of doing anything outside a very simple, rigid routine that she lived on the narrowest possible plane of existence and had distorted ideas about what constituted a good marriage.</p>\n<p>What could both my clients do? I explained to them, when I realized what disturbances their mates had, that they could do one of three things: seek a divorce or separation; encourage their spouses to receive psychological treatment; or continue to live with their untreated mates and learn to put up with their disturbances.</p>\n<p>Usually, in cases like this, clients see the first of the three alternatives as undesirable or impractical, since separation or divorce, especially involving children, means heartache and hardship. They see the second alternative as desirable but unfeasible, because the mate will refuse to accept professional treatment. They find living with a “neurotic” and avoiding driving themselves to the brink of despair, the third alternative, both desirable and practical.</p>\n<p>To help you try this solution, I have developed a teaching technique that tells you exactly what to do to live successfully with a “neurotic.” This book outlines some of the elements of this teaching.</p>\n<p>For example, I enabled the thirty-year-old woman to see her husband as an exceptionally frightened and insecure person, who felt he had suffered seriously in his relationships with his mother and two previous woman friends, and consequently felt loath to get emotionally involved with anyone else lest he again experience rejection and feel “destroyed.” When his wife understood this, and persisted in giving him warmth and security in spite of his initial coolness, he gradually warmed up, drew considerably closer to her, committed himself to the risks of emotional involvement, and displayed more devotion.</p>\n<p>The case of the fifty-year-old man did not get so easily resolved. His wife proved to have a borderline psychosis and barely maintained her hold on reality by living in a highly restricted fashion. She didn’t want therapeutic help, and even consistent kindness and devotion by her husband could not unthaw her. I taught him, finally, to accept her with her disturbance and to see that her coldness resulted from this disturbance rather than from his own behavior. He had essentially two choices: to separate from his wife or to accept her with her borderline state. Since he did not wish, partly for religious reasons, to take the first choice, I helped him to take the second, to realistically inure himself to the fact that he lived with a frequently disturbed woman.</p>\n<p>These two cases typify, not the problems that beset individuals living with “neurotics” or “psychotics,” but the choices they confront. For assuming that you live, for whatever reasons, with a consistently disturbed spouse, relative, friend, or business associate, you usually have innumerable bad choices but only two or three good ones. Either you choose to help this person get less disturbed and easier to live with or, if you won’t or can’t do this, you choose to live with him or her in spite of the continuing disturbance, with a minimum of distress to yourself. In some instances you can use a combination of these two sensible approaches.</p>\n<p>In trying to show you how to live successfully with a “neurotic,” this book may also give you some valuable insights into yourself and your own “neurotic” trends. For one of the best ways to know yourself comes through understanding and helping others.</p>\n<p>Take, by way of illustration, another of my clients. A young mother came to see me because she regularly had serious difficulties with her mother-in-law, who insisted on telling her just how to handle her child, how to treat her husband, and how to manage her life. Having felt rebellious toward her own mother, and having no intention of acquiring an even more dominant overseer through her marriage, she typically fought tooth and nail with her mother-in-law, much to the distress of everyone involved, especially her husband.</p>\n<p>I let her do considerable talking, at first, about her mother-in-law. I came to understand that the mother-in-law had the best of intentions—but the worst of anxieties. She would not, in her own life, make even the tiniest decision for fear of making a horrible mistake. She therefore kept trying to make other people’s (including her daughter-in-law’s) decisions for them. She could thereby evade any responsibility or self-condemnation if, somehow, these decisions turned out wrong, since she had not actually made them.</p>\n<p>My client began to see that what she previously had considered her mother-in-law’s strength and overdecisiveness actually masked this woman’s weakness and indecisiveness. Seeing this, she began to lose her antagonism; and, instead of resenting the older woman’s attempts to boss her around, she now began to pity her and to try to give her more love and security. Relations between the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law eventually grew almost cordial!</p>\n<p>One day the client came to me and spontaneously said: “You know, I’ve had a chance to think about how my mother-in-law used to act with me and the reasons for her acting as she did. And it occurred to me, as I told my oldest daughter how to do her schoolwork the other day, that I have something of my mother-in-law in me, too. After all, I had a bullying mother, just as she had, and I tended to let my mother have a serious effect on me, too—my indecisiveness, I mean. I often hesitate dreadfully in doing things.</p>\n<p>“And as I heard myself tell my daughter how to do her schoolwork the other day, I suddenly got the picture of my mother-in-law doing exactly the same sort of thing to me. I realized for the first time how much we have in common. I don’t like contemplating that, naturally. But I sure do see it!</p>\n<p>“Would you believe it—when I saw that, I suddenly stopped, right in the middle (the middle, I mean, of telling my daughter about her schoolwork), and I said to myself, ‘Now look here—stop bullying that child. You just want her to act better than you do, to behave more decisively. But that way won’t work. You’ll just continue to avoid, instead of to face, your own problems. Let the child alone! You behave just as badly as your mother-in-law!’ And I did stop right there, and told her she could do the work any way she liked, as long as it satisfied her. I felt much better after that.”</p>\n<p>Understanding others, then, often opens the road to understanding yourself. And understanding others’ disturbances halves the battle to understand your own neurotic trends. If we live, as we seem to live, in an age and a culture in which emotional disturbances flourish, we’d better face the fact that we ourselves may well have some degree of disturbance. And, in addition, we go through life encountering and often getting involved with others’ hangups.</p>\n<p>Can we recognize, understand, and help with some of the neurotic problems with which we keep coming into contact? The fundamental premise of this book holds that we can.</p>\n</body>\n</html>"

And they can. For, as humans, we learn (or teach ourselves) our neuroses; and anything we learn, we normally can unlearn.</p>\n<p>The “neurotic’s” feeling of hopelessness hangs on belief in his or her hopelessness. This appears as one of the most distinctive, and, one might say, most human, characteristics of men and women: that what they believe in they usually accept as truth; what they think they can’t change, they can’t change. But if humans believe they can change, they almost always can actualize this belief. And if you believe that you can help them change, you have an excellent chance of doing so.</p>\n<p>I once saw an outstanding lawyer. After twenty-five years of marriage, he had still not learned to satisfy his wife sexually, and when I suggested some obvious ways, he immediately objected: “But how can I change my sex habits, Dr. Ellis, after having them so long?”</p>\n<p>“You,” I responded, “regard yourself as a good trial lawyer, do you not?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>\n<p>“And every time you get a new case, you carefully plan it according to your past experience with this kind of case, and with judges and juries, do you not?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, surely.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” I said, “suppose, after working on one of your cases for a while, you discover that your plan doesn’t work. What do you do—stubbornly stick to it, because you originally outlined it that way?”</p>\n<p>“Why, of course not. I plan a new strategy, make another effort.”</p>\n<p>“Why, then, don’t you do the same thing about sex with your wife? Your old strategy hasn’t worked for twenty-five years. What do you plan to do—use it for another twenty-five?”</p>\n<p>“I never thought about it that way.”</p>\n<p>“Well, don’t you believe you’d better—assuming that sex with your wife means as much to you as winning a court case?”</p>\n<p>P.S. He did start to think about it and soon worked out a much better adjustment.</p>\n<p>People, then, feel hopeless and often look hopeless as long as they think themselves hopeless, and consequently make no effort to change. For change involves effort; and effort involves a goal, an idea. And the essence of change itself derives from the idea that things can get better—that they can change. Observe how the concept of hope negates hopelessness.</p>\n<p>Applied to the “neurotic” with whom you have steady contact, this means that if you have a concept that he or she may change, an idea that he or she need not remain hopelessly disturbed, you probably have gone halfway toward effectively helping. And I have spent many years as a practicing therapist giving exactly this concept to my clients who intimately associate with troubled people.</p>\n<p>Consider one man who consulted me because, while he worked at finishing his graduate studies, his wife got exceptionally jealous of his school activities. As soon as he settled down with his books, she would stop her reading or television-viewing, and start talking to him about irrelevant, unimportant things. When he pointed out that he had to study, she said that his work obviously meant more to him than she did, that he never spent any time with her, and that he clearly didn’t love her anymore. This led to a lengthy argument, which, by the time they had calmed down, generally consumed the evening, and left his scholastic tasks undone.</p>\n<p>At my urging the husband tried a different tack. Before he did any schoolwork, he spent a period of time expressing warmth to his wife, telling her that he loved her, and sometimes making sexual advances. He discussed his school activities with his wife and made an effort to get her to feel as much concern about them as he felt himself. He told her, especially, about his difficulties with this professor or that instructor, and asked her how she thought he could handle these situations.</p>\n<p>Finally, my client induced his wife to help him with his lessons. He had her do some of his typing and arithmetic, and read to him when his eyes got tired. She soon took a vital interest in his work and felt she practically belonged in class with him. After a few weeks of this new approach, which succeeded in winning her active cooperation, they began to get along much better. Her neurotic self-downing lessened as she saw herself making a valuable contribution to her husband’s education.</p>\n<p>The same kind of plan will work with many “neurotics.” To try to argue or bully them out of their disturbed behavior frequently makes things worse. But if you attempt to discover why they act the way they do, and what you can do about getting them to act better, you have an excellent chance of helping them—and, of course, helping yourself at the same time. For people often act more psychologically than logically. If you treat them in an understanding way, you can accomplish wonders in some of the seemingly most “hopeless” cases.</p>\n<p>Understanding and helping others depends largely upon how you see things. Most people get so involved in their own problems and worries that they take little time or energy to comprehend anyone else’s point of view. If you can manage to see things from another’s vantage point, you can often provide inestimable help.</p>\n<p>Relevant here, I recall the case of a woman, an excellent secretary, who normally enjoyed her job. Because she upset herself about her husband’s criticism, however, she began doing badly at work, lost her interest in it, and wanted to quit. Her husband opposed this and pointed out that they could well use the money she earned. She tried explaining her feelings, but to no avail. She began to feel guilty, as well as depressed.</p>\n<p>As I frequently do in this type of case, I decided to try to use the husband as an auxiliary therapist, and I asked to see him. He spent most of our first session complaining about his wife’s “unreasonable” desire to quit work. He thought she did an excellent job for her employer and that she would feel much happier working than not working. He didn’t understand why she couldn’t see this.</p>\n<p>I carefully explained to him that, theoretically, his position made good sense. If his wife left her job, she not only would hate herself for running away when the going got rough, but also would lose the confidence she derived from her competency at work, and might therefore tend to feel more ineffective in other respects. She then might hate herself even more, creating a vicious circle.</p>\n<p>The husband, gratified to hear that I agreed with his analysis, positively beamed, and indicated that he would now go home and belabor his wife with my words and thereby get her to do things his way. I could vividly see him loading his shotgun with the verbal ammunition I had just supplied.</p>\n<p>“You’ve got the point,” I said. “But let’s look at the thing another way for a moment. Your wife, by wanting to quit work, acts illogically, against her own best interest. But does she see it that way? Does she not, rather, feel that just because she now does poorly on the job, she will lower her confidence by remaining on it, and will then perform worse in other respects? Doesn’t this encourage her to feel forced into leaving, even though she knows the disadvantages, monetary and otherwise, of doing so?”</p>\n<p>Yes, he could see that, he said.</p>\n<p>“And let us go one step further,” I continued. “Your wife knows that, when she did well on her job a while ago, she still got into trouble with you—about the housework and things like that—doesn’t she?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I guess so.”</p>\n<p>“And now that she contemplates leaving work, she knows how unhappy you feel about this?”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Well, if—to her way of looking at things—doing a good job doesn’t satisfy you and brings her little of the reward she really wants—your love and consideration—why should she keep rewarding you for what gets her beaten over the head? Why would it not make more sense—seeing things, again, from her frame of reference—for her to do something that would punish you for the unjust way that she thinks you generally treat her?”</p>\n<p>“Now that you put it that way, I guess it might.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly. So I think you’ll understand what you’ve actually done—even though you haven’t realized it. You’ve punished her when she does well (on the job, for instance) by criticizing her about the housework. Then, when she does poorly, and thinks of quitting, you unconsciously reward her by letting her see how unhappy you feel. From her point of view, therefore, if she wants to get back at you for what she considers your unfair criticism, how might she best do this?”</p>\n<p>“Just the way she does it now, I guess—punish me by wanting to quit her job.”</p>\n<p>“Right. So she really doesn’t seem so crazy after all, does she?”</p>\n<p>“I should say not!”</p>\n<p>By showing this husband how to understand and see things from his wife’s frame of reference, I helped him to diminish his criticism of her. He stopped making an issue of her every fault and inadequacy. He minimized some foolish things she did, pretended not to notice others, and generally employed a more constructive approach. Sensing his changed attitude, she began rewarding him—and herself—by doing better at her work, which soon killed any question of her leaving her job.</p>\n<p>In this instance I helped a woman with neurotic thinking to remove some of the pressure she put on herself by first having her husband remove his pressure. When he began to see her actions in her frame of reference and to treat her with understanding, she recognized her own distortions of reality and did something about them. When her husband accepted her as a wife and as a human, she accepted herself as an effective secretary as well.</p>\n<p>This did not, of course, represent an ideal solution to her problem. She might have profited more if, in spite of her husband’s severe criticism, she had decided to accept herself fully—decided, for instance, that she wanted but did not need his love, and that she could have distinct (though decreased) enjoyment even though he cared less.</p>\n<p>In any event, “neurotics” can learn to see things differently themselves, and hence to change their disturbed behavior. And they learn particularly well when others begin to see them in a different light and to give them leeway to move along less neurotic pathways.</p>\n<p>Sometimes still more direct methods help emotionally perturbed people solve their problems. A mother came to see me about her twenty-one-year-old daughter’s fear of staying alone in the house. The daughter insisted that one or both of her parents remain with her whenever she stayed at home. I tried to see the daughter, but she refused to come in for even one session. I, therefore, worked through the mother, who served as an auxiliary therapist.</p>\n<p>I asked the mother, in this case, to try a planned method of deconditioning the daughter’s fears of remaining alone. I got her to visit a nearby neighbor, ostensibly for a few minutes, and then deliberately stay longer. She called from the neighbor’s, from time to time, to tell the daughter that for some reason she would delay returning a few minutes longer. Gradually, she built up the time of staying away from ten to twenty minutes, and then increased it to thirty or forty minutes.</p>\n<p>Every time the mother stayed away for any length of time, she would remark (on my instructions) as soon as she got in: “Sorry Mrs. So-and-So detained me, but you know how gabby she can get. Anyway, you seem to have done fine in my absence. Why, I’ve actually stayed away thirty minutes, and you’ve done beautifully. I always knew you could and I’ll bet you don’t really feel so afraid anymore.” Eventually, after continuing to lengthen her visits over a period of several months, her daughter got more and more used to the idea that she could get along by herself and actually remain alone in the house. She gradually got over her fears.</p>\n<p>We find many ways, then, of helping a “neurotic.” None of them succeeds with enormous ease; some require considerable effort. But if you take the time and trouble to apply them, they work—and often work better than your wildest expectations lead you to believe. Not that you can expect miracles, although people often describe as miraculous what happens to a person when a properly coached member of the family helps him or her emotionally.</p>\n<p>Said one of my clients: “I can’t thank you for what you have done for us, for me and my family, Doctor. It seems like a miracle.”</p>\n<p>I replied: “Not what I’ve done, but what you’ve done has accomplished this ‘miracle.’ I, as I told you during our very first session, can help you understand things, can point out ways in which you can aid yourself. But you do them, act on them. I can’t do anything for you; you can work—and have worked—beautifully to help yourself. You really have yourself to thank.”</p>\n<p>This woman accepted her nineteen-year-old daughter’s harsh verbal attacks, which had continued for almost ten years. Instead of making herself angry as she had done before coming to see me, she began to understand how and why they arose, and to meet them with concern and kindness. The result, achieved within six weeks, amazed her. The daughter not only stopped berating the mother, but began cooperating, desisted from spending all her time in the college library, and began dating boys. A real “miracle.” Yet, only a little understanding, a changed maternal attitude, occurred. Nothing but that—and a nineteen-year-old who seemed doomed to self-downing and hostility now had more than an even chance to enjoy herself and to relate to others.</p>\n<p>Can anyone help anyone else to overcome emotional quirks and upsets? No, not exactly. For the prospective helper, aside from having good intentions and real patience, better not have too severe a disturbance; ditto, the helpee. Individuals with severe problems should preferably see professionals; and those who would help them can obtain psychological consultation. Otherwise, more harm than good may result.</p>\n<p>This means, specifically: Don’t try to cure your friends or relatives who feel exceptionally depressed, who think very little of themselves, who experience unusual agitation, or who behave bizarrely. Such individuals may prove psychotic and require immediate professional care and sometimes institutionalization. By all means try to get them to those with training.</p>\n<p>The fact remains, however, that many of our intimates do not require professional care—even though almost all of them might well benefit from at least a few consultations. And many who would better have intensive psychotherapy, simply won’t. These people can often get considerable help through the wise intercession of a friend or relative willing to take the time and trouble to understand them and to assist in guiding them through their perplexity.</p>\n<p>Instructive in this connection: The case of a mother who came to see me to complain that her twenty-nine-year-old unmarried daughter didn’t really care to try to find a husband. She went on dates with males, but somehow didn’t go with the marrying kind; and whenever my client pointedly brought this fact to her attention, the daughter would argue and scream like a fishwife and tell her to mind her own business. What, the mother asked, could she do with a child like that?</p>\n<p>I, too, tried to get the mother to mind her own business. I attempted to show her that, if her daughter did not marry, she probably just didn’t want to. Or, if she did, she perhaps did not have sufficient confidence to try to find the right kind of man; or she disturbed herself so much about her mother’s incessant proddings that she possibly enjoyed spiting the mother by not marrying. Anyway, I said, at twenty-nine years, what she did or did not do about marriage fell well beyond her mother’s control. The less the mother nagged her, the more likely she would get married.</p>\n<p>The mother couldn’t see this at all, and thought that I had collaborated somehow with her daughter (and the devil) to keep her unmarried. I saw that I wouldn’t get anywhere, since she didn’t face her own contribution to the “problem,” and kept insisting that I see her daughter as unbalanced and ungrateful. So I asked her to send the daughter to see me. I frankly hadn’t thought so much of working with the daughter—though she probably could use the help, too—except to see whether I could induce her to assist me with the mother’s problem.</p>\n<p>When the daughter came in, I realized immediately that she really had problems. But she acknowledged this willingly and wanted to do something to help herself. After several visits, she developed insight and began to see, as I had guessed from my first talk with the mother, that she resented her mother’s prodding her into marriage, and resisted by selecting unmarriageable boyfriends. Putting this insight to good use, she began to get more selective in her choice of steady dates and to work toward a good relationship with one of them.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, even before she changed her dating pattern, I got her to help me with the mother’s problem. After I explained her parent’s disturbance, the daughter stopped arguing with her mother and, at my suggestion, calmly accepted almost everything she said. Realizing her mother’s overanxiety, she would tell her mother just what she wanted to hear about the men she, the daughter, dated. No matter how outlandish or provocative the advice, she calmly went—or at least seemed to go—along with whatever her mother said (even though, in practice, she often completely ignored her mother’s views).</p>\n<p>When the mother, impressed with the daughter’s changed attitudes, and especially with her newfound serenity, found nothing negative to respond to, she began to calm down. She came to see me several weeks later, apologized for her previous antagonism, and said that she loved the changes I had wrought in her daughter, who had begun to behave like “a completely different girl.”</p>\n<p>Actually, the daughter had not changed that much, although she had begun to tackle her own basic problems and eventually (some six months later) solved many of them. The mother, ironically, considerably improved herself. Her daughter’s example of determined, reasonable behavior removed much of her own excuse for irrationality. Where I, as psychotherapist, at first failed to make any inroads on the mother’s neurosis, the daughter’s insight and actions helped enormously.</p>\n<p>My intimate association with many cases like these encourages me to believe that, with the proper knowledge and effort, almost any nonprofessional without too many problems can help a close relative, friend, or associate who has more troubles—providing, of course, the helper understands neurosis, its probable causes, and some of the methods that can change neurotic behavior patterns. With this knowledge, and a strong determination to apply it in practice, he or she can often achieve remarkable results.</p>\n<p>What, then, does “neurotic” mean, and what makes a person “neurotic”?

For you will find many truly stupid people around. These individuals, because of inherited or early acquired mental defects, do not think clearly, act grown-up, do things effectively. They do not have the intelligence to plan and execute rational modes of living. Not knowing enough to come in out of the rain, they frequently get soaking wet. But because there exists a definite physical (neurological) reason for their nonrational, childish behavior, we cannot accurately label them “neurotic.”</p>\n<p>Neurosis, moreover, may get confused with unhappiness. Some people—millions, in fact—behave appropriately unhappily. Take, for instance, those who do not have enough to eat, who work at poor jobs, or who have chronic illness. Can they reek with happiness?</p>\n<p>“Neurotics,” then, make themselves unreasonably or unnecessarily bothered or bewildered. They bring on more pain or anxiety than they, theoretically, need experience. Many of them have more than enough wherewithal—good looks, high intelligence, fine talents—to get along successfully in this world. But somehow they don’t. That “somehow,” that “something,” that comes between their potential abilities and their actual achievements—that we call “neurosis.”</p>\n<p>We cannot easily say who acts and who does not act disturbed for the fundamental reason that “neurotics” cover up marvelously. They want, last of all, recognition for their degree of foolishness or neurosis. They resort to all kinds of subterfuges and defenses to prevent recognition of their true emotional colors. They compartmentalize, for instance, and hold their neurotic behavior to one or two major aspects of their lives, while acting with reasonable normality in most other respects. Or they compensate and do a splendid job in one area—such as in their business dealings—while virtually falling apart in other respects. Or they go through silly rituals and magical devotions within the confines of their own homes but act convincingly sane on the outside.</p>\n<p>Many “neurotics,” consequently, seem happy and effective to some of their closest associates, even though a pitiably thin line separates them from serious disturbance.</p>\n<p>We have another obstacle in the way of recognizing neurotic symptoms in their almost infinite variety. “Neurotics” tend to act peculiarly—to some degree irrationally and “crazily.” But the roads to emotional perplexity remain many. Where one “neurotic” has terrible fears of doing almost anything, another shows his disturbance by needlessly risking his neck every day in some dangerous enterprise. While one lies abed all day and refuses to do any work, another frantically consumes himself in a dozen violent endeavors. One woman insists that she has wasted away from a score of imaginary ills; and another with a cancerous ovary insists that she has no disease, that death does not exist, and that her Yoga breathing exercises will take care of all her ills.</p>\n<p>A further problem in distinguishing neurosis from other forms of irregular behavior emerges in the fact that eccentricity and neurosis differ. Virtually all “neurotics” behave, in one way or another, eccentrically; but not all “eccentrics” behave neurotically. If a Henry David Thoreau, for example, wants to desert Concord society for a while to live in the Walden woods, or if a Mahatma Gandhi wishes to lead a movement of passive resistance against the British, these eccentricities and heresies do not necessarily constitute proof of emotional aberration. Rebels and saints occasionally display craziness, but not always.</p>\n<p>You can—though not easily—disagree profoundly with the great majority of your fellows and yet, in your own life’s goals and ideals, act consistently. Neurosis suggests an inner contradiction, a discord between what you want to do for yourself and the means you use to achieve your goals. Eccentricity may merely entail a contradiction between your ideals and those of your neighbors. It does not have to, though it may, constitute a symptom of disturbance.</p>\n<p>How, in view of some of the confusing evidence and of our inability to see inner contradictions and unconscious conflicts, can we tell a “neurotic” from a so-called “normal” or “well-adjusted” individual? Mainly, by recognizing his or her most important neurotic manifestations or symptoms. Some of the main symptoms of emotional disturbance include:</p>\n<h3>Indecision, doubt, and conflict.</h3><p>“Neurotics” often act with indecision, hesitancy, doubt. They want to do something but fear making a mistake, failing in their own and others’ eyes. So they waiver, decline to make decisions, refuse to commit themselves or to take full responsibility for almost anything. One woman I knew left her husband to live with another man, but then kept finding fault with her lover because he lacked some of the characteristics of the husband. She waivered between the two, and literally shuttled back and forth between them several times, before she finally saw that the real issue involved not their traits but her own indecisiveness. When she faced this fact, and started to work on her own problems, she had no trouble making up her mind—in this instance in favor of the husband.</p>\n<h3>Fear and anxiety.</h3><p>Virtually all “neurotics” have an irrational fear of something. On the surface they may appear the fearless, mountain-climbing type. Underneath—jelly. More than anything else they fear what people think—feel terrified of not having others love and approve of them. Sometimes they honestly admit this. But often they translate their fears of disapproval into more concrete phobias, such as the fear of walking on the street, or of staying cooped up at home. Look beneath their defenses and you’ll find an irrational dread. What gives “neurotics” the shakes? Everything imaginable! I have seen strong, hulky brutes of men who have quailed at the sight of a small bug, or who refused to take a plane trip, or who broke into a sweat at the mere idea of going to a party, or who would not go through with a job interview if their lives depended on it. I have seen women who bore five children without flinching who would go into an extreme state of panic at the contemplation of exchanging an article in a store, or of getting examined by a physician, or of eating a banana, or of giving a bridge party. Some of the physically bravest “neurotics” feel terribly afraid of what others may say or think.</p>\n<h3>Inadequacy feelings.</h3><p>People with emotional problems often feel inadequate, worthless, or wicked. They think that they should do this and do only that; or should do that and do, alas, only this. They do not merely recognize their own faults; they inordinately magnify them. Above all, they think a serious failing makes them a total failure. They condemn not only their poor traits, but themselves, their entire personhood, for having such unfortunate traits. One of the worst instances I have ever seen: a woman whose husband kept blatantly regaling her with stories of how many other women he saw and how he had sex with them. When, after driving herself to distraction, she sought the sympathetic ear of one of her male cousins, and started to become attached to him because of his kindness, she began to feel terribly guilty, to look upon herself as the vilest kind of adulteress, and to think that she did not make a fit mother for her children. I had a difficult time showing her that her unrealistic self-demands and her consequent feelings of worthlessness, not her adultery, truly underlay her ceaseless self-criticism.</p>\n<h3>Guilt and self-blame.</h3><p>People with severe problems usually have severely moralistic codes. They blame others and themselves for innumerable desires and deeds. As Sigmund Freud emphasized, they have particular difficulty accepting their own sex drives. But this often represents only the tip of the iceberg, for they also condemn themselves for many non-sexual deeds. They tend to get too conscientious in their thoughts and too lax in their actions. They know what they should do—and don’t do it. Then they berate themselves unmercifully. One of my clients who had the highest standards of personal conduct and honesty obtained a job doing door-to-door selling of encyclopedias. He liked the work because he felt that he could help raise the cultural level of the families to whom he sold, and he began to do very well at the job. After a while, however, he upset himself so much about the possibility of making the slightest exaggerated claim for his product that he spent hours rewording his memorized sales talk. Even that did not satisfy him, and he began to add all kinds of qualifications and hedgings, so that his customers began to feel that he wanted to apologize for even trying to sell them the books. Naturally his sales fell off and, in sheer desperation, he sought psychotherapy. He finally helped himself when he began to see that his phobia against telling any kind of story or half-truth stemmed from his acceptance and perpetuation of his mother’s great fear that he would follow in his father’s footsteps, cheat at cards, and thereby go “bad.”</p>\n<h3>Supersensitivity and oversuspiciousness.</h3><p>People with disturbances often behave suspiciously. They do not merely believe that others dislike them; they look for, actively ferret out, and seek until they ultimately find this dislike. They feel such underlying guilt about their own behavior that they convince themselves that everyone sees them through their own distorted vision and, consequently, detests them. A clear example: One of my clients noticed that I sometimes put two fingers over my upper lip and hold them against the under part of my nose. This I do indiscriminately, with clients, friends, intimates. Said this particular woman: “I see that you hold your fingers over your nose. You do this because you think I smell bad, don’t you?” “No,” I replied, “but obviously you think that I (and everyone else) thinks you smell bad.” “How did you know?” she asked.</p>\n<h3>Hostility and resentment.</h3><p>Many “neurotics” behave with hostility and resentment. Hating themselves, they tend to hate others. Feeling that the world unfairly does them in, they think they have to retaliate in kind. Frustrated, largely by their own irrational behavior, they often respond with the common sequel—aggression against the presumably frustrating society and the people in it. The treasurer of a group to which I once belonged kept getting into difficulties with the other officers of the group because he insisted on doing things in a high-handed, unorthodox manner. When the others complained about his methods he felt most aggrieved, and viewed them as unfair spoilers of his projects. As a result of his frustration—or, actually, of his telling himself that he must not get frustrated —he acted with hostility not only toward his fellow officers, but toward almost everyone else. If given the chance, he would complain for hours at a time about politicians, bureaucrats, modern fiction, mothers-in-law, school systems, and a dozen other pet annoyances. He never saw that his hostility did not stem from his disliking interference from others, but from his internally commanding that everyone do things his way.</p>\n<h3>Ingratiation.</h3><p>Many people spinelessly curry favor with others at the expense of their own self-acceptance. In an effort to win love and approval, they slavishly bow to their relatives and associates, abase themselves—and then hate themselves more and feel greater insecurity and rejection. Moreover, because they loathe their own ingratiating tendencies, they frequently try to compensate by reversing themselves and beaming hostility toward those whose favor they seek. One of my own acquaintances indulges in a typical neurotic pattern in which he apologizes to his wife for everything he does or does not do; then he will verbally slice her to ribbons for some trivial error, such as forgetting to pick up the laundry. Similarly, one of my clients encourages her father to use her as a doormat. Then she complains to me for hours about how nastily he behaves. When I point out to such people that there may exist a connection between how they bow down to others and how they hate these others, they often have trouble seeing how the first of these attitudes can lead to the second. But once they do see the connection, act assertively, and give up their ingratiating behavior, a large part of their hostility vanishes.</p>\n<h3>Inefficiency and stupidity.</h3><p>“Neurotics,” even when they achieve at a high level, act inefficiently. Many do things badly or not at all. Others do too much or achieve success the too-hard way—with a needless sacrifice of time, nervous and physical energy, and pleasure. They work unsystematically, without proper planning, or work compulsively, with involved systems that bog them down and promote complications. They block so emotionally that they will not or cannot think their problems through. Or they think them through rationally enough and then continue to act in the same irrational manner as before. I treated a woman majoring in philosophy and doing exceptionally well. One day she came to me and said that her parents had left their home for a while, and that she kept house so sloppily in their absence that she actually feared an invasion by rats. “Why don’t you clean the place?” I asked. “Oh, but in such lovely weather,” she replied, “I’d rather sit in the sun and enjoy myself.” “But you don’t weigh up the whole equation,” I said. “You don’t think logically.” “What do you mean?” “Well, you measure doing the housework against sitting in the sun and enjoying yourself. Naturally, in terms of that equation, you’ll continue to sit in the sun. But the truer equation includes: sitting in the sun—and having unpleasant things constantly hang over your head; or doing the housework—and feeling free to enjoy yourself later by sitting in the sun, or doing almost anything else you please.” “Yes, I guess that sounds about right.” “Now which side adds up to the most enjoyment?” “I see.” She promptly began cleaning the house.</p>\n<h3>Self-deceit and lack of realism.</h3><p>Virtually all “neurotics” lie to themselves and refuse to accept reality. Instead of squarely facing their frustrations, admitting their failings, or unwhiningly accepting the grim facts of life, they tend to rationalize, evade issues, blame others, and construct a picture of the world that contains more poetry than truth. A physician whom I had known from college days continued to visit me every few years, and each time he arrived he would have in tow a good-looking female companion who obviously had nothing in common with him intellectually. He would take me aside during the course of the evening and long-windedly explain what fine traits she had, her sexual advantages, and how she behaved more desirably than women of his own cultural and intellectual background. I would quietly ask a few pointed questions to indicate my skepticism about his achieving a lasting relationship with her; but he would defend his choice spiritedly. Then, on his next visit, he would tell me how rightly I had guessed about the last woman; but this one, now—and he would launch into a highly unrealistic evaluation of his current companion’s qualities. Only after a good many years had passed, and my friend finally had some intensive psychotherapy, did he feel free to admit that his going with the whole series of attractive women resulted from his underlying deep-seated feelings of inadequacy in the presence of those who showed brightness and substance. These inadequacy feelings had led him, via the common route of wishful thinking, into unrealistically assessing his companions and deceiving himself into believing that they had remarkable assets.</p>\n<h3>Defensiveness.</h3><p>Once they begin lying to themselves, “neurotics” set up defense systems against their having to face unpleasant realities. Usually, they devise an elaborate network of devious reactions, and consciously pretend that they feel or act one way when they unconsciously respond to quite a different set of feelings. Some of the common forms of neurotic defensiveness:</p>\n<ul><li>Rationalization—Providing a reason for the commission of an act one considers blameworthy. Examples: The mother who has a neurotic urge to criticize her son, but insists that she does so only for his good; the man who collects pornographic literature and insists that he does so only because of his scientific interest in sex.</li><li>Compensation—Acting well in one area to set up a smoke screen for neurotically running away from another dangerous area. Examples: The woman who, afraid to go to dances, practically lives in the public library instead, and develops outstanding knowledge of medieval history; the man who develops into a great baseball team manager because he fears he would not excel at playing the game.</li><li>Identification—Compensating for one’s own weakness by closely allying oneself with someone who appears to have strength. Examples: The coward who believes himself a “real man” because he associates with bullies and bruisers; the somewhat homely teen-age girl who feels at one with a highly attractive female movie star and refuses to acknowledge her own deficiencies.</li><li>Projection—Throwing the blame or responsibility for one’s own failings onto others. Example: A man who hates his father accuses the father of hating him; or incorrectly views other men as hating their fathers.</li><li>Repression—Unconsciously forgetting about aspects of one’s own behavior of which one feels ashamed or which one looks upon as painful. Examples: The woman who cannot remember anything about the night she went to bed with a stranger; the fellow who remembers only the tennis games he won and conveniently forgets those he lost.</li><li>Resistance—Refusing to face unpleasant facts about oneself, even when they get pointedly brought to one’s attention. Examples: The therapy client who refuses to admit that he has hostile feelings toward his mother when his therapist demonstrates that his relations with her have clearly followed a hostile pattern; the card player who insists that he plays well even when he makes many mistakes.</li><li>Transference—Unconsciously feeling toward a person attitudes not based on reality, but on that person’s having some traits in common with individuals, especially one’s parents, to whom one may have previously had attachments. Examples: The teen-ager who, because he resents his parents, may feel rebellious toward teachers, policemen, and other authority figures; the man who loathes his second wife because she has a few traits in common with his mother and his first wife.</li><li>Grandiosity—Overcompensating by seeing oneself as having better traits than one actually has because one fears, underneath, that one behaves inadequately. Examples: The revolutionist who, in order to establish himself as kingpin, sets up a group of his own that actually differs little from the group from which he has broken; the man, who, although he lives irresponsibly, thinks that the world owes him a living because of his imagined superiority.</li><li>Reaction formation—Refusing to acknowledge feelings (such as anxiety or hostility) that one does not want to face, and unconsciously expressing the reverse emotion. Examples: The mother who really loathes her son, but smothers him with affection and insists she adores him; the fellow who feels insanely jealous of his friend’s prowess, but refuses to admit this to himself or to others and, instead, acts as this friend’s best press agent.</li><li>Refusal to perform—Avoiding or postponing a performance or test one fears failing, and telling oneself one would succeed if one did buckle down to it. Example: The college student who puts off doing his work till the end of the term, takes his exams without having had time to catch up with the work, and then tells himself that if he had worked harder he would have done marvelously.</li></ul>\n<h3>Rigidity and compulsiveness.</h3><p>“Neurotics” feel unsafe, insecure. In an effort to attain a greater degree of security, they frequently adopt an arbitrary set of rules and stick to them rigidly. Because they have anxiety about doing the wrong thing, or about letting their thoughts and deeds get beyond their control, they tend to pick certain aspects of life that they can easily control and then stick compulsively to these straight and narrow paths. They often devise magical rituals and formulas—such as going through a studied routine before bedtime—to give themselves a feeling that some unknown power protects them as long as they adhere closely to their chosen formulas. One of the college students I treated took six sharply pointed pencils into every examination and lined them up neatly in front of her. Then she proceeded to ignore them entirely and used a ball-point pen for the exam. She thought that if she temporarily forgot anything she had studied for the exam, the reserve pencils would magically help her recall this reserve material. After she had achieved more confidence, as a result of several therapy sessions, she would take her exams without the compulsively arranged extra pencils, for she then felt able to rely on her general ability rather than on a special ritual.</p>\n<h3>Shyness and withdrawal.</h3><p>Believing that they may easily do the wrong thing and that others will spot their mistakes, numberless “neurotics” act shyly and retreat into various kinds of solitude. Constructively, they may follow solitary occupations such as working alone in a laboratory or in a forest as a ranger. Destructively, they may merely avoid people, stay alone in their rooms, or act as hermits. They thereby draw for themselves one of the frequent neurotic vicious circles: because they fear people they withdraw from society—and thus enhance their fear. A twenty-two-year-old male had immense difficulty getting up in the morning. When he finally did start for work, he would stand in a corner in the end compartment of the train and face the side of the compartment so that others could not see him. He took his lunch to work and remained alone in his office to eat it. When he returned home at night, he ate quickly and then went right to bed. Initially so shy that he literally would never look other people in the eye, when at last he managed to do this without blushing and quickly averting his gaze, you’d have thought he had just made the varsity football team or won a Phi Beta Kappa key.</p>\n<h3>Antisocial or psychopathic behavior.</h3><p>Many “neurotics” take a rebellious path from the start, and try to compensate for their underlying feelings of inadequacy by acting as “tough guys” or cynics. A few go to extremes and consistently behave delinquently or criminally. Although some psychologists view these so-called psychopaths as special kinds of warped personalities, my own experience with scores of them convinces me that, at bottom, their “psychopathy” represents a defensive covering used by frequently confused, frightened individuals to harden themselves against underlying feelings of rejection and deep-seated supersensitivity. Relatively few “neurotics” deserve the label “psychopath”; but dig beneath so-called psychopathic behavior and you often find a neurotic (or psychotic) underpinning. As chief psychologist of the New Jersey Department of Institutions and Agencies, some years ago, I interviewed a young man who had a long series of delinquencies, including burglary, holdups, and stolen cars. At the time I saw him he had just gotten apprehended for shooting his woman friend, crippling her for life, because he jealously objected to her wearing sweaters that revealed her buxom figure to other males. He showed not the slightest remorse about this act, nor about any of the criminal acts he had perpetrated. All told he displayed remarkable coolness. In the course of the interview I asked this man a few routine questions about his sex history, including any oral genital relations with females. “Whadya mean by asking questions like that?” he bellicosely interrupted. “Whadya think I’d do that for, anyway?” “You mean,” I asked, “that you think such acts wrong?” “Wrong! I should say so! Besides, whadya think the other guys would say about me if I did things like that? How could I ever face them?” Behind even the hardest “psychopathic” mien, then, we often find neurotic supersensitivity.</p>\n<h3>Psychosomatic symptoms and hypochondria.</h3><p>Many physical ailments have a neurotic component. People sometimes worry themselves into sickness by keeping their muscles and nervous systems in a state of hypertension, thus helping to bring on such psychosomatic complaints as ulcers, high blood pressure, asthma, and heart palpitations. Moreover, when they do contract a physical ailment, they sometimes prolong and aggravate it, using it as an excuse for their emotional upsets. One of my many hypochondriac clients complained that he just could not stop worrying about the possibility of serious illness. If he had a pain in his head, he saw a certain brain tumor. A simple cough convinced him that he had tuberculosis. A stomach twinge set him to thinking of cancer. And whatever he thought he had, he saw as fatal. “Why do you keep worrying about these illnesses all the time?” I asked. “Well, because I could die, couldn’t I? And at my young age, too, before I’ve barely lived!” “Maybe so,” I said. “But did it ever occur to you that you spend so much time and energy worrying over the possibility of dying young that you actually give yourself no opportunity to enjoy the one life you’ll ever have? Under these conditions, what have you to live for, anyway?” “Not very much, you make it appear.” “You mean,” I said, “you make it appear. Only you can wreck your life by worrying over something almost entirely beyond your control.” “I never thought of it that way,” said the client. “Maybe you’ve got something there.” And shortly thereafter, he began to think more and worry less.</p>\n<h3>Crackpotism and bizarreness.</h3><p>Not all “eccentrics,” as we previously noted, behave neurotically, but plenty of them do. As they don’t tend to get along too well in this world, they frequently try to create a world of their own and acquire all kinds of crackpot, bizarre notions about how to live. When “neurotics” get sufficiently bizarre and lose sight of reality entirely, we call them “psychotics.” We regard neurosis as a reasonably mild evasion of reality; psychosis represents an extreme form of escape from the real world into one of illusion or fantasy. “Psychotics” generally have an even lower estimate of themselves than do “neurotics,” and consequently the defenses they erect against fully accepting themselves take on more drama than neurotic defenses, often consisting of hallucinations, extreme projections, godlike feelings, and the like. Or else “psychotics” overaccept their “faults,” continually berate themselves, and get into extreme depression. “Neurotics” may also engage in bizarre behavior, though such behavior does not necessarily suggest the need to get carted off to the nearest mental hospital. The superintendent of the apartment house where I once lived kept inventing schemes for winning at the racetrack. Essentially, his system consisted of doubling his previous bets and keeping on doubling until finally a winner came up. He had considerable intelligence and experience with racing, not to mention the awareness that any such scheme as this might only work when backed by virtually unlimited funds. With limited resources at his disposal, however, he insisted on trying one new scheme after another, and of course he lost heavily. But he so desired to make a killing, to prove his genius to the world and thereby magically erase his tremendous underlying feeling of worthlessness, that he continued to devise bizarre, surefire betting systems.</p>\n<h3>Depression.</h3><p>A few people manage to compensate well for their inner insecurities and remain outwardly content. But average “neurotics” often feel intense depression. They tend to fill themselves with self-pity and pessimism. As Drs. Aaron T. Beck and Paul A. Hauck have shown, depression and neurosis frequently go hand in hand. A family friend, a sixty-year-old woman, depressed herself as miserably as anyone I have ever seen. Every time she came to visit, her face literally lined with misery, she had copious tears as she described the woeful time she had had during the past few days. Night after night, she reported, she lay awake, sometimes until early morning, crying, sighing, moaning, verbally bewailing her sorrowful lot. The presumed cause of her despair? The fact that her only living son seemed determined to die a bachelor, thus leaving her with no male grandchildren. (Her daughter, mother of two girls, had passed childbearing.) Because this “horrible” situation, she alleged, negated her entire purpose in life, she might just as well never have come into this world. When I attempted to show her that this situation itself could not possibly have caused her depression, but that her unrealistic and childish attitude toward the situation had caused it, she considered me an unfeeling brute who had no understanding of a woman’s role in life.</p>\n<h3>Self-centeredness and inability to love.</h3><p>Most “neurotics” have an inordinate desire to receive, and an infinitesimal willingness to give love. They feel so incessantly concerned with themselves and their own problems that they have neither the time, the energy, nor the inclination truly to care for another person. They often fall violently in love, usually grasping obsessively after individuals whose love they think they need. But they show little ability to care: to want to help others achieve their own growth and happiness for their own ends. I particularly remember, in this connection, one of the first girls I dated, as a teen-ager. She, because of what I later began to see as her acute self-downing, had a tremendous “need” for love, adoration, and approval. When she met a boy who she believed would meet her demands, she quickly and violently attached herself to him, and insisted that she loved him passionately. Then, as soon as she discovered that her beloved did not wish to worship her exclusively to bolster her ego, but instead had some deep-seated desires of his own, she took the discovery as an absolute betrayal, insisted that he did not “really” or “truly” love her, and broke up the relationship to seek a new great love. This ceaseless, fruitless search for perfect love has continued, as far as I know, to the present day, through several marriages and innumerable affairs. However, she has never sought, for one, the answer to the question: “Why do I keep demanding amatory perfection?”</p>\n<h3>Tenseness and inability to relax.</h3><p>Because they preoccupy themselves with constant worry about the rightness or wrongness of their behavior, “neurotics” rarely will relax. As a result, they suffer from a tension which may evidence itself in muscular ailments, poor coordination, or the inability to sit still. Sometimes psychological tension results, and they report that they feel emotionally numb, would like to take out their brains and place them in the refrigerator, or fear something but don’t know what. If we did not make a certain amount of effort, we would hardly succeed in doing anything or getting anywhere. But “neurotics” experience unnecessary effort: strain caused by their groundless fears, their overconcerns about what other people think about them. I saw a young woman who could only with great difficulty describe her tenseness. She felt ashamed that she bit her nails. But aside from this information, she could hardly tell me how she felt. She would vaguely start a sentence: “I don’t know what to say—I can’t tell you how I feel—I just don’t know . . .” Then she would hesitate before taking another stab: “I can’t tell—I don’t want to do anything. No, I don’t mean that: I don’t know what I do want to do. I just don’t know exactly how to put it . . .” Only after considerable questioning could I elicit the fact that she felt extremely restless. She thought she could stay in her own room for no more than a few moments; did not feel comfortable even when talking to her parents; would read for only a few pages at a time; did nothing, in fact, for more than a short while without jumping up and wanting to do something else. Why did this woman feel so tense? Because most of the things she wanted to do, such as championship ice-skating, her parents opposed; and either she refrained from doing them or did them with a feeling of guilt. What she did not want to do—including going to art school—her parents virtually insisted upon. So, either she refused to do these things and angered herself about her parents’ pressure or she did them and made herself feel guilty. The only independence she let herself achieve she got by actively rebelling against her family. Then she upset herself about her “nasty” rebelliousness. No wonder she rarely felt relaxed!</p>\n<h3>Overexcitability and manic tendencies.</h3><p>Some “neurotics” instead of getting depressed make themselves overexcited. Trying to compensate for their (conscious or unconscious) feelings of inadequacy, they act as exhibitionists, overbearing, or life-of-the-party-ish. Others, to avoid facing their own disturbances, constantly attempt to keep themselves stimulated by outward forms of excitement; normal conditions of daily life leave them bored and listless. We find a prime example of neurotic extraversion in the case of a thirty-six-year-old male whose parents largely ignored him as a child to devote most of their attention to his highly talented older sister. Because he still keeps whining about this, he feels he now cannot bear feeling ignored or even unapplauded by anyone. Though not manic, he easily falls into surliness and depression. If he does not continually impress people, he thinks they will find him inferior. Enormously self-centered, he has little real interest in other people and no main goal aside from showing off. Consequently, he strives incessantly for attention—to find the center of some group. If this group gets into something different and unconventional—such as playing strip poker—so much the better. He will participate in the attention—and admiration, he believes—that accrue to the group, and he will (literally and figuratively!) outstrip the others. “Anything for excitement!” he avers. But he really means: “Anything to divert me from thinking seriously about myself and facing my intense feelings of inferiority!”</p>\n<h3>Inertia and lack of direction.</h3><p>Many “neurotics” tend to feel unenergetic and to lack definite vital interests. They place themselves on a sort of sitdown strike against life, since they believe that the world owes them a living and should not require them to work hard or to discipline themselves to get the things they want. Deep in their hearts, they do want to strive for something, to realize some goal. But as soon as they meet difficulties in their striving, they give up and withdraw from competition. Then getting back to work comes even harder because it leads to poor accomplishment, which in turn encourages a feeling of hopelessness and more inertia. One twenty-six-year-old came to see me because of his impotence. We soon discovered that both his father and mother worked exceptionally hard building a large commercial enterprise by devoting almost all their waking hours to it. He resented this, feeling that the time his parents put into the business belonged rightfully to him. Because of his resentment, he hated work and spent most of his time hanging around poolrooms and bowling alleys. In his sex relations he also refused to “work” at satisfying his partners, and hence made himself impotent. Only after he began facing his sitdown strike against employment and against females did he start working well and displaying sexual adequacy.</p>\n<h3>Overambitiousness and compulsive striving.</h3><p>Some “neurotics” compensate for their self-flagellation by working themselves practically to death. Not that all hard workers rate as disturbed. In fact, individuals with self-acceptance usually work harder than the average. But “neurotics” overwork because they feel so insecure that they think they need fame or fortune; because by constant activity they can distract themselves from some of the psychological pain with which they plague themselves; because work often gives them an excuse to avoid things they terribly fear—for example, engaging in love affairs or attending social gatherings. A woman of my acquaintance achieved real distinction as a writer of historical novels. She felt depressed, however, and once when I discussed her problems with her she freely admitted that most of her success as a writer had come from very hard work. Where other writers did months of research for a novel, she did years. She spent hour after hour in the library, rewrote her plots and her characterizations again and again, drew involved maps and genealogical tables, and generally so perfected everything she wrote that her readers always marveled at the fineness of her details. And well they might, since these details she wrung, so to speak, from her very life’s blood. She admitted that, although she had had financial and critical success from her teens onward, she had never really done much for herself, for her own happiness. She sought so intently for the highest possible achievement, for getting acclaim, that she rarely took vacations, attended shows and concerts, or relaxed at home. She lived mainly for her work; made herself into a nonentity as a personality.</p>\n<h3>Escapism and avoidance of responsibility.</h3><p>Instead of facing and working out serious difficulties, “neurotics” frequently see a problem and run. They refuse to discipline themselves or to assume the normal responsibilities of life. Often they attempt to live as perpetual children, and if they marry, they live as child-wives and child-husbands. If they can literally run away from normal exigencies, they do: to a new home, a new job, a new marriage, a new wardrobe. When they cannot actually run, they balk and sulk. One of my most difficult clients, a young man with a positive genius for avoiding the tasks of life, never kept a job for more than a few weeks and contended that he found the work too hard, the boss impossible, or the hours too long. He never considered marrying any of his many female companions, but saw this one as too demanding, that one as too compliant, and the other as too this or too that. He failed to vote because he considered his city’s registration and voting regulations too onerous and time-consuming. I allowed this client to meander along in therapy for over a year, during which time he gave me countless excuses for his inability to do one thing or another. I kept pointing out that he continually sabotaged himself by his do-nothing attitude. Finally, after I had given him enough rope to hang himself ten times over and he had proceeded to use it for exactly that purpose, he began to stick with one job and to develop a good relationship with one woman. I commended his progress. “Yes,” he said, “I guess I’ve surprised you. Well, let me tell you the reason for my change. I’ve worked with you for eighteen months now—which seems rather long for your therapy. But I’ve learned one thing in those eighteen months, and if I never learn anything else from this process, that one thing will remain with me for the rest of my life.” “What?” I asked. “Simply that, although I still find getting up and going to work every morning hardly the most pleasurable thing in the world, I now know, and shall remember, that I find not working much worse.” “You mean?” “I mean that while working steadily and assuming certain responsibilities often gives me a pain—though less pain as I continue to do so—not working and not assuming those responsibilities usually brings me far more pain. I waste my time and decrease my present and future enjoyment when I don’t work. And I worry so much about what I’d better do that I hardly enjoy the here and now.”</p>\n<h3>Alcoholism and drug addiction.</h3><p>“Neurotics” frequently use alcohol and drugs to escape reality and to temporarily reduce anxiety. Unfortunately, these “escapes” boomerang on their users, since they help create increased disturbance and hence lead to a desire for still larger doses. Even when drugs and alcohol temporarily work, the users know that, without their aid, they cannot do the things they fear, so they obtain no increased confidence. Indeed, they usually hate themselves all the more for using these self-defeating “tranquilizers,” and the usual vicious neurotic circle results. A man with typical alcoholic symptoms had an excellent position but also had a somewhat rigid supervisor. He liked the work but hated the supervisor. He reluctantly faced this hatred, however, because it too closely resembled his feelings toward his own father, a person with traits similar to his supervisor’s. To avoid this conflict, he frequently would not show up for work, giving himself the excuse that he did not feel well. His absences got so frequent that he made himself feel ashamed of phoning in his excuses. Whereupon his supervisor would call to find out why he had not shown up. Afraid to face these calls, he would drink himself into insensibility so that he could not hear the phone, or would sit staring at it while he counted the number of rings. Then, when it finally stopped ringing, he would feel so ashamed that he would go on a binge for several days. After he sobered up, he would go back to work for a while, but then begin the same pattern of absenteeism and drinking. When he faced his unconscious hostility toward his father and realized he had transferred these resentments to his boss, he saw what he typically did to anger himself and to express his anger. With the aid of rational-emotive therapy, he then attacked his own childish beliefs—especially the belief that he should have a loving, kind father-boss. And when at last he stopped condemning himself and others, and instead only criticized and tried to change his and their behavior, he lost his compulsion to drink.</p>\n<h3>Self-downing and self-punishment.</h3><p>In addition to downing themselves for their poor traits, some “neurotics” damn and punish themselves for their main “sin”—their neurosis. Starting with unrealistic, perfectionist assumptions that create feelings of general inadequacy, they actualize their self-fulfilling prophecies and do things they think they “cannot help” doing. Then, noting their “inevitable” weakness or “badness,” they do something weaker or meaner. This leads them to flagellate themselves more, instead of only judging their poor behavior. As a grim example of self-whipping, I remember an administrative assistant at an institution where I worked. He felt marital sex relations permissible only when they resulted in childbearing. Always on the brink of financial insolvency, however, he and his wife could not afford to add to their brood of four children, and therefore they regularly employed birth-control procedures. The husband felt so guilty about this that he would frequently quarrel with his wife during the day, thus making it almost impossible for them to have satisfactory sex relations at night. On the few occasions when he succeeded in having intercourse, he managed either to perform ineffectually or unenjoyably. One of my clients who frantically tried to lose weight kept backsliding on her diet. Often, after overeating a little, she deliberately punished herself by going on to eat half a box of candy or drink several bottles of beer. When she took a more realistic attitude toward human failings and accepted herself with her foolish behavior, she made real headway with dieting.</p>\n<p>The main message of this chapter boils down to this: “Neurotics” theoretically have the capacity to act effectively, creatively, and free from sustained anxiety and hostility. However, because they hold irrational, unrealistic assumptions—such as the philosophy that they must win universal approval, that they should not get frustrated, or that they’ve committed a horror if they fail at something important—they create and sustain (mainly by constant negative self-talk) disturbed and self-harming emotions.</p>\n<p>When “neurotics” manufacture overconcern, rage, guilt, feelings of worthlessness, and depression, they can choose to consciously experience these self-sabotaging emotions or set up unconscious defenses against them. Their defenses may include self-deceit, projection, rationalization, evasiveness, psychosomatic complaints, alcoholism, drug addiction, antisocial behavior, compensation, or other forms of escapism.</p>\n<p>Often, because they have general philosophies of damnation and atonement, “neurotics” first hate themselves for not displaying the perfection they think they should display. Then, once they develop disturbed feelings or ineffectual behavior, they additionally loathe themselves for their neuroses. A vicious circle thereby arises: as a result of unrealistic beliefs they behave badly, condemn themselves further for thus behaving, and consequently add greatly to their emotional woes!</p>\n</body>\n</html>"
